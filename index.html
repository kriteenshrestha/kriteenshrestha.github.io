								<p>Hello! My name is Kriteen Shrestha, and I am a 22 year old Nepali-American, born and raised in San Jose, California. I grew up a very curious kid, and I developed interests in a wide range of areas: from math, art, music, physics, baking, crafts, and languages (specifically about Newar/Nepali and Japanese culture). With such a range of interests, academically I have gravitated towards interdisciplinary fields and growing my tool kit to be as diverse as possible, in order to search for interdisciplinary solutions. </p>

        <h2 class ="major">Junior Breakthrough Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                My father used to chat to my sister and I about so many interesting physical and mathematical phenomena. One day, he told me that prime numbers, something that felt so elementary, were the key to our internet security! I was really surprised, and he had encouraged me to research this further, giving me the book, Music of the Primes.
                To pursue this research further, I did the Junior Breakthrough Challenge in my sophomore year of high school, where I self-studied prime numbers, the RSA algorithm, and the Riemann hypothesis (and how its solution challenges RSA!). 
                This really ignited my love and passion for math and its interdisciplinary solutions, and I vowed to pursue such works as I went on to college.
                
            </p>

<p>
                Inspired by the work I was able to do last year, I continued my passion. I got into the idea of concepts that were true, but just unprovable -- again, through a playful conversation with my dad!
				It lead me to studying infinite ordinals, and how their existance is used to solve finite problems. It was another moment of realization as to just how important math is to so many fields. This validated my passion to pursue mathematical concepts like this in college.
            </p>

        <p> 
			Participating in the Junior Breakthrough Challenge wasn't about the contest, for me -- I placed 60th then 40th percentile. But getting the first hand experience of doing personal research in topics I found very interesting, and then being able to present and teach your research in a 3 minute talk, all coupled with a fun animation I got to do (exercising my love for art), was very fruitful for me to be able to do in high school, for it gave me a tiny glimpse as to what I would be able to do further in my education and career.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/zoom.png" alt="" /></span>
								Global Classmates was a program my high school Japanese class took a part in. <a href="https://kacultures.org/en/gc-summit/global-classmates-summit-2021/" target="_blank">Kizuna Across Cultures</a> was an organization that provided Japanese students and American students the opportunity to interact and learn what it is like to have an international experience.
								I got selected out of 1,952 U.S. students to participate in the Summit where the seven selected American students interacted with other seven selected Japanese students in both English and Japanese. In this summit, I learned a lot.
								I learned cross-cultural communication skills in order to discuss common societal issues, like social hierarchies and defining personal identity.
I got mentored from international leaders and experts in fields like diplomacy, and presented in Japanese about the importance of diverse identities and establishing stronger international relations.
								</p>
								<p>
									I made many good friends through this program, and I feel very fortunate to be able to be a part of something that helps the world become a better place.

								<p>
									Stanford University Mathematics Camp, or SUMaC, was a 8 week accelerated math program for high school students all around the world, and I had the priviledge of assisting their studies in the summer of 2025.
									Right away, I was very surprised with the rigor and pace that the students were facing, with curriculum tackling algebraic topolgy, number theory, abstract algebra -- college level courses -- right off the bat.
									It was a priviledge to be able to guide them with their work, and organize and lead research groups on topics related to number theory and cryptography. 
								</p>
								<p>
									This was very full circle for me, as I myself became inspired to study math in high school after reading the book, Music of the Primes, and studying the RSA algorithm and the Riemann hypothesis.
									I had done the Junior Breakthrough Challenge for two years in high school (as I explain in <a href="#JBC">JBC</a>), inspired by these same topics I was introducing for topics of research for my students. (Links to my work here! __)
								</p>
								<p>
									I helped students research and give talks on such a wide variety of topics:
									<ul>
									<li>Prime Number Theorem and Riemann Hypothesis</li>
									<li>Diffie Hellman and El Gamal Cryptosystems</li>
									<li>Quadratic Residue and Goldwasser-Micali Public-Key System </li>
									<li>Breaking Security: Shor's Algorithm and Quantum Cryptography</li>
									<li>Learning With Errors, Ring Cryptography and Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC)</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									It was very inspiring for me to see these students genuinely eager to learn such important and difficult topics, and I feel honored to be able to have been a part of their journey.
