								<p>Hello! My name is Kriteen Shrestha, and I am a 22 year old Nepali-American, born and raised in San Jose, California. I grew up a very curious kid, and I developed interests in many areas: from math, art, music, physics, baking, crafts, to languages (specifically  Newa, Nepali and Japanese). With such a range of interests, academically I have gravitated towards interdisciplinary fields and growing my tool kit to be as diverse as possible, in order to search for interdisciplinary solutions. </p>

								<h3>ECE Senior Capstone 2025</h3>
								<p> During my senior year of college, as my capstone project, I built a scalable intelligent agricultural telemetry system that provides users with data-driven real-time insights and promotes sustainable farming practices, with my team and mentors.

									In this project, we:
									<ul>
									<li>Leveraged a distributed network of sensor modules to collect important environmental data that
are communicated wirelessly via LoRa, and analyzing the environmental data such as soil moisture and nutrient levels. Designed and built a custom PCB sensor unit using Kicad and a weather proof housing component on Autodesk Fusion 360 to deploy out in the fields.
</li>
									<li>Created a model using Python scikit-learn and OpenWeatherAPI to create a predictive watering reccomendation system and to provide artificial intelligence-aided suggestions for effective irrigation. 
</li>
									<li><strong>Won 2nd Place Best Capstone Project during the UCSB ECE Capstone Presentation Session 2025.
									</strong></li>
									<li>
									Are projected to present at the International Telemetry Conference (ITC) 2025 later in October 2025.

        <h3 class ="major">Junior Breakthrough Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                My father often sparked my curiosity by discussing fascinating physical and mathematical phenomena with my sister and me. One day, he explained that prime numbers—something that once seemed so elementary—are actually the foundation of internet security. I was astonished. Inspired by his encouragement, I dove deeper, exploring the topic through the book Music of the Primes.

				To expand my understanding, I participated in the Junior Breakthrough Challenge during my sophomore year of high school. There, I self-studied prime numbers, the RSA algorithm, and the Riemann Hypothesis—including how its resolution could challenge the very security RSA provides.

				This experience ignited my passion for mathematics and its interdisciplinary applications, solidifying my commitment to pursue such research as I continue my academic journey in college.

            </p>

<p>Inspired by the work I had explored the previous year, I continued to pursue my passion for mathematics. Once again, a playful conversation with my dad introduced me to the intriguing idea of statements that are true yet unprovable.

This curiosity led me to study infinite ordinals and their surprising role in solving finite problems. Experiencing this “aha” moment reinforced for me just how foundational mathematics is across so many fields. It also strengthened my resolve to continue exploring such deep and elegant concepts in college.</p>

        <p> 
			For me, participating in the Junior Breakthrough Challenge wasn’t about the competition—I placed in the 60th and then 40th percentile. What truly mattered was the experience of conducting personal research on topics I found fascinating, then presenting my findings in a three-minute talk. Adding a creative animation to illustrate my work allowed me to combine my love for art with my passion for mathematics. This experience was invaluable in high school, giving me a glimpse of the kind of research and interdisciplinary exploration I hope to pursue in my future education and career.

        <h3 class ="major">Automated Garage Door System</h3>
            <p>
			In Winter 2024, I took ECE 153B: Sensors and Peripherals, where my partner and I designed and implemented an automated garage door system. The system was driven by a half-stepping stepper motor and used an SPI-interfaced accelerometer to detect door position. Control was achieved via UART-based terminal commands or temperature-triggered automation using a TC-74 sensor (I2C). We also added Bluetooth functionality via the HC-05 module.            </p>

								Global Classmates was a program my high school Japanese class participated in. <a href="https://kacultures.org/en/gc-summit/global-classmates-summit-2021/" target="_blank">Kizuna Across Cultures</a> provided Japanese and American students the chance to interact and gain a taste of international experience.
								I was selected from 1,952 U.S. applicants to join the Summit, where seven American students collaborated with seven Japanese students, communicating in both English and Japanese. Through this experience, I developed cross-cultural communication skills while discussing shared societal issues, such as social hierarchies and personal identity.

I was mentored by international leaders and experts in fields like diplomacy, and I had the opportunity to present in Japanese on the importance of diverse identities and fostering stronger international relations. This experience gave me a deeper appreciation for global perspectives and the power of cultural exchange.

							I made lasting friendships through this program and feel truly fortunate to have been part of an initiative that fosters understanding and contributes to making the world a better and more unified place.

							As a tutor with Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) at UCSB, I worked closely with undergraduate students enrolled in lower-division physics courses (PHYS 6A/6B/6C and PHYS 7A/7B/7C). I helped students grasp challenging concepts, guided them through problem-solving strategies, and supported their preparation for exams and assignments. 
							Beyond reinforcing course material, I aimed to foster confidence and independent learning skills, making the often-intimidating subject of physics more approachable and engaging. This experience strengthened my communication skills and deepened my appreciation for teaching and mentorship in STEM education.									</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/ntcblackboard.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Stanford University Mathematics Camp (SUMaC) is an eight-week accelerated program for high school students from around the world, and I had the privilege of instructing and mentoring students during the summer of 2025. I was immediately struck by the rigor and pace of the curriculum, which introduced college-level topics like algebraic topology, number theory, and abstract algebra right from the start.

It was a privilege to guide students through challenging material, organize research groups, and mentor them on projects related to number theory and cryptography.
								</p>
								<p>
									This experience felt full circle for me: I had first been inspired to study mathematics in high school after reading Music of the Primes and exploring the RSA algorithm and the Riemann Hypothesis. It was incredible to realize that the very topics that had inspired me in high school (as described in <a href="#JBC">JBC</a>), were now the topics I was introducing and inspiring my students to investigate.
								</p>
								<p>
									During SUMaC, I helped students research and present on a wide variety of subjects, including:
									<ul>
									<li>Prime Number Theorem and Riemann Hypothesis</li>
									<li>Diffie Hellman and El Gamal Cryptosystems</li>
									<li>Quadratic Residue and Goldwasser-Micali Public-Key System </li>
									<li>Breaking Security: Shor's Algorithm and Quantum Cryptography</li>
									<li>Learning With Errors, Ring Cryptography and Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC)</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									It was incredibly inspiring to see students genuinely eager to tackle such complex and important topics. I feel honored to have played a part in their learning journey and to have shared my passion for mathematics in such a meaningful way.
